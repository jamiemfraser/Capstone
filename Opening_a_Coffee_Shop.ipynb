Most neighborhoods have at least one coffee shop already, and many neighboorhoods have multiple coffee shops. Due to the competition, it is important to select the right neighborhood to open this new coffee shop. They want to select an area that has enough traffic to support the coffee shop and produce a good profit, but not be in an area where there are already too many coffee shops and thus the market risks becoming oversaturdated."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "Finally, they want to distinguish their coffee shop to make sure that it is a comforable and unique space for customers to enjoy their coffee and work or study.

This can help to chose a location for the shop, as well as identify neighborhoods which may be oversaturated or have too many competing shops. Data on the neighborhoods with the highest number of reviews for coffee shops will help to identify nighborhoods with the highest traffic, and therefore the most customers, for coffee shops. Finally, it is important that the coffee shop stands out and is unique among competitors in the area. Thus, Foursquare data on the details on existing coffee shops, such as photos and reviews, will provide information on competitors and help to design the menu and look of the coffee shop."}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.7", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.7.10", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
