# Capstone Portfolio
This repository contains the projects that I completed as part of the Applied Data Science capstone project, in fulfilment of the requirements for the IBM Data Science professional certificate on Coursera. The course was completed in July of 2021. Projects and skills learned include:

1. Clustering Toronto Neighborhoods
    * Calling geospatial data using the Foursquare API
    * Webscraping to find data on Wikipedia
    * Using K-means clustering to generate a map of location-defined clusters

2. Opening a Coffee Shop
    * Using advanced Foursquare querying techniques to obtain data on caf√©s and coffee shops in Honolulu, Hawaii
    * Generating a k-means cluster model to identify the best neighborhoods to open a new coffee shop, as part of a mock business case exercise
